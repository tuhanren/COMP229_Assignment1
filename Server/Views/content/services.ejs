            <p>During my previous experience, the Data Analyst role brought me in touch with all

          <p>The pandemic offers me the chance to step into this area which I feel very greatful.
              This is the very first web project that I have. I inplement it with Express, 
              a back-end web application framework for Node.js. In this site, I also include other skills
              like bootstrap, fontawesome, jquery, yarn, npm, lootie, typed, etc. All I know so far, I will
              add to here.
